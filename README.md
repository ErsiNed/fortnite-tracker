## üöÄ Features

- Track real money transactions by category (V-Bucks, Crew Pack, Quest Pack, etc.)

## üåê API Capabilities

I've implemented complete REST capabilities as standalone endpoints. 
While the current web interface uses traditional Django templates, the API layer is fully functional 
and ready for future JavaScript or mobile integration.

**Available Endpoints**:
- `POST /api/token/` - Get JWT tokens (provide `username`/`password`)
- `GET /api/users/` - List all users (requires JWT)
- `GET /api/users/<id>/` - Get user details

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies

- **Python 3.11+** & **Django 4.2**
- SQLite (default, can be swapped for PostgreSQL)
- Bootstrap 5
- HTML5 & CSS3
